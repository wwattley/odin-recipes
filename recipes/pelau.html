    <h1>Pelau Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Trini pelau is an iconic recipe from the island of Trinidad that is often made on weekends and when family and friends get together for a lime (Caribbean slang word for get-together). This one-dish meal originating in the French West Indies combines pigeon peas, meat or chicken, and rice along with fresh herbs and coconut milk. The entire dish is then flavored and colored with burnt sugar</p>

    <p>In this recipe, chicken thighs gain that signature Caribbean flavor from the marinade that includes green seasoning, a typical spicy herb mixture similar to sofrito. Pigeon peas are legumes that have a nutty flavor and are frequently paired with rice and other grains. They are available dried, canned, or ground into a flour. Canned pigeon peas can be used in this recipe and are found in most large grocery stores or specialty Indian and Latin food shops.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, place the chicken, green seasoning, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and ketchup, along with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>Toss to mix and coat the chicken with the seasonings. Set aside and let marinate for at least 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Pour the oil into a large pot and place over medium-high heat. Let it heat until hot but not smoking.</li>
      <li>Make the burnt sugar by sprinkling the cane sugar into the hot oil in an even layer.</li>
      <li>Let the sugar melt until it starts to froth and bubble.</li>
      <li>As soon as the edges of the froth/bubbles start to turn a slight shade darker, immediately add the seasoned chicken. Stir to mix and coat with the burnt sugar.</li>
      <li>Let cook for 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the rice to the pot, stir to mix and cook for 3 minutes</li>
      <li>Add the onion, red bell pepper, pigeon peas, and carrots (if using) and cook for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Pour in the coconut milk and the chicken stock or water. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>Toss in the whole Scotch bonnet pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil and cover the pot.</li>
      <li>Once it reaches a boil, partially remove the lid and continue to boil for an additional 7 to 8 minutes.</li>
      <li>Cover the pot fully, reduce the heat to low, and let cook for 25 to 30 minutes or until all the liquid has been absorbed.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle the green onions on top and fold into the pelau. Taste and adjust seasonings with salt and pepper if necessary.</li>
      <li>Serve hot or at room temperature and enjoy.</li>
